<h3>FrequencyReactiveTacile</h3>
<p>The code currently in use, it works with puredata and stuff! The mic no longer works, which is strange because it was working fine eariler in the prototyping stage. No one have been able to get the audio sources working since it broke, even after stripping down everything to just the audio data, and trying clean examples from the github the scripts came from... Baffling!</p>

<h3>audioSanityTest</h3>
<p>Uses the same i2s pins as the above script... And it works!</p>

<h3>TODO</h3>

    This appears to be the ultimate final solution to all audios related to Arduino! ... Now to read the docs.
