									Universal Music Design (UMD) recently had an exciting unboxing day where they
									unveiled a plethora of innovative technologies aimed at revolutionizing the music
									experience. Among the highlights were the Woojer Vest3 Haptics, RF transmitter and
									receivers, Woojer Edge Haptics, Electrospit, and 16x mixer Behringer.
								</p>
								<p>
									One of the most awe-inspiring discoveries of the day was the power and longevity of
									the Woojer Vest3. Its immersive haptic feedback capabilities left the UMD team
									amazed, coupled with its impressive battery lifespan. The team immediately saw the
									potential for integrating this technology into their projects to provide an
									unparalleled music experience for both deaf and hearing individuals.
								</p>
								<p>

									mixing in recording studios. By leveraging these mixers, UMD aims to elevate haptic
									music production to new heights, offering users a dynamic and immersive musical
									journey.
								</p>
								<p>
									Shawn Trail, PhD, expressed his excitement about the novel experience of feeling
									music in the same way it's heard. With the integration of cutting-edge haptic
									technologies, Shawn noted that his ears are getting a well-deserved break, while
									still enjoying the full richness of the musical experience.
								</p>
								<p>
									Myles de Bastion, Director of CymaSpace and a nearly blind and deaf individual, also
