								<h2> CymaSpace and Universal Music Design Present #DeafJazz: The Jazz Prism Project - A
									Revolutionary Accessible Jazz Experience</h2>
								<p>
									CymaSpace, in partnership with Universal Music Design (UMD), is thrilled to announce
									The Jazz Prism Project, an innovative concert series designed to make the
									transformative power of jazz accessible to the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH)
									community. This groundbreaking event series will provide an immersive, multi-sensory
									jazz experience through visual and haptic technology, redefining the way audiences
									engage with music.
								</p>
								<h2>About the Jazz Prism Project</h2>

								<p>Funded by the prestigious South Arts Jazz Roads Tour grant, The Jazz Prism Project is
									a pioneering initiative that brings together cutting-edge jazz musicians and
									visionary DHH artists. Featuring the newly formed ensemble The Confluence, the
									project incorporates a fusion of technology and artistry to deliver an accessible
									jazz experience like no other.</p>

								<p>The Confluence, led by vibraphonist Jake Chapman and saxophonist Tony Barba, combines
									the talents of deaf guitarist and CymaSpace founder Myles de Bastion, deaf music
									producer Nate Hergert, and percussionist Shawn Trail, alongside Universal Music
									Design’s lead engineer Dillon Simeone. Together, these musicians bring jazz to life
									through a unique blend of electro-acoustic soundscapes, audio-reactive visuals, and
									immersive haptics.</p>

								<h2>A Jazz Experience Reimagined for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing</h2>

								<p>Inspired by the work of renowned Deaf percussionist Evelyn Glennie, the project
									utilizes cutting-edge technology to make jazz accessible beyond auditory perception.
									With 27 channels of spatial haptics provided by Music: Not Impossible, DHH musicians
									and audience members can feel the music as it resonates through their bodies.
									Additionally, 50 Woojer haptic vests will be available for DHH attendees, allowing
									them to experience vibrations that mimic the nuances of jazz music, effectively
									using vibrations as “headphones.”</p>

								<h2>The Importance of Sonic Agency</h2>

								<p>The Jazz Prism Project is not just about providing access to music but about creating
									Sonic Agency for the DHH community. By enabling DHH individuals to feel, see, and
									engage with jazz in alternative ways, the project expands the concept of
									accessibility in the arts. Jazz has been a powerful medium of emotional resonance,
									political expression, and social connection, and this project ensures that the DHH
									community can partake in its transformative impact.</p>

								<p>As #DeafJazz artists blend jazz, electro-acoustics, and innovative technology, they
									are pioneering a new genre of music that transcends hearing, allowing all
									individuals to experience jazz’s impact on the human spirit.</p>

								<h2>Tour Dates and Events</h2>
								<p>The Jazz Prism Project will tour across Oregon, offering a series of immersive
									concerts and educational workshops designed to deepen the connection between jazz
									and the DHH community:</p>

								<ul>
									<li><b>December 5, 2024</b>– Southern Oregon University (Closed Workshops for Honors

									participants an opportunity to engage hands-on with haptic technology, experience
									audio-reactive visuals, and explore new interfaces for musical expression. The
									workshops will be tailored to students and the DHH community, offering insight into
									the innovative technologies used and the artistic vision behind #DeafJazz.</p>

								<p>
									The Haptic Zoo event at Woodstock Cafe, hosted by CymaSpace and Universal Music
									Design, was an outstanding success! Held on August 30, the event introduced
									attendees to a world where touch, sound, and technology seamlessly intersect. The
									cafe was buzzing with excitement as visitors had the unique opportunity to
									experience various haptic devices, including wearables and furniture, with the added
									magic of live music and interactive games.
								</p>

								<p>Live Demos & Sensory Exploration Visitors enjoyed live demos of VibroSonics
									technology, which has been integrated into one of the benches, allowing participants
									to feel the sensation of music through vibrations. VibroSonics, led by Chet Udell,
									focuses on translating audio frequencies into tactile sensations, enabling Deaf and
									Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals to experience music and other auditory cues
									through vibrations. The system's encoding process, which was initially created by
									the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science teams, allows for a detailed and
									immersive touch-based experience. This device not only bridges the gap for DHH
									individuals but also offers a novel sensory experience for everyone.</p>

								<p>Why VibroSonics Stands Out The VibroSonics system is powered by ESP32 microprocessors
									and an audio-to-haptic encoder algorithm. This enables the bench, along with other
									wearables showcased, to vibrate and pulse according to the music's rhythm and
									intensity. Using technology inspired by famous examples such as SubPac, the
									VibroSonics team focuses on creating devices that allow users to feel music through
									their skin, whether they are at a concert, a game, or simply enjoying music.</p>

								<p>Bridging Communication Gaps with Haptics One of the event’s highlights was the focus
									on how haptics can assist the DHH community in overcoming communication barriers. By
									converting sound into vibrations, devices like the VibroSonics bench provide
									critical sensory cues, allowing Deaf individuals to "feel" their surroundings and
									participate in immersive environments.</p>

								<p>With this successful event, CymaSpace and Universal Music Design continue to
									demonstrate their commitment to making arts, culture, and technology accessible to
									everyone, regardless of ability.</p>

								<p>Join Us Next Time With such positive feedback from attendees, we're excited to
									continue exploring the endless possibilities of haptics and its role in
									accessibility. Stay tuned for future events, and come experience the beauty of music
									and touch for yourself!</p>

									One of the most awe-inspiring discoveries of the day was the power and longevity of
									the Woojer Vest3. Its immersive haptic feedback capabilities left the UMD team
									amazed, coupled with its impressive battery lifespan. The team immediately saw the
									potential for integrating this technology into their projects to provide an
									unparalleled music experience for both deaf and hearing individuals.
								</p>
								<p>
									The 16x mixer Behringer also caught the team's attention, as they realized its
									potential for enhancing haptic experiences in a manner similar to traditional audio
									mixing in recording studios. By leveraging these mixers, UMD aims to elevate haptic
									music production to new heights, offering users a dynamic and immersive musical
									journey.
								</p>
								<p>
									Shawn Trail, PhD, expressed his excitement about the novel experience of feeling
									music in the same way it's heard. With the integration of cutting-edge haptic
									technologies, Shawn noted that his ears are getting a well-deserved break, while
									still enjoying the full richness of the musical experience.
								</p>
								<p>
									Myles de Bastion, Director of CymaSpace and a nearly blind and deaf individual, also
									shared his enthusiasm for the new technologies. In a video embedded in the playlist
									above,
									Myles can be seen experimenting with haptic guitar solos on the Woojer Vest3,
									showcasing the transformative potential of these advancements in music technology.
								</p>
								<p>
									With the unboxing of these groundbreaking technologies, Universal Music Design is
									poised to continue pushing the boundaries of music accessibility and innovation,
									ushering in a new era of inclusive and immersive musical experiences for all.
