				<h2>Woojer Vest 3 Rental Programs</h2>
				<p>
					We are excited to offer the rental of 50 high-end Woojer Vest 3 haptic vests. These vests deliver
					spatial haptics, allowing users to feel vibrations from all directions. This technology is
					particularly beneficial for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community, as it can separate complex
					music into left and right channels, enabling the appreciation of musical elements without it turning
					into white noise. Our vests are ready to enhance your events with a truly immersive experience!
				</p>
				<h2>Accessible Music Design</h2>
				<p>Our studio specializes in creating music that is tailored for the DHH community. We ensure that our
					compositions can be enjoyed without becoming overwhelming or losing their essence. Examples of our
					works:<ul>
						<li>Example 1</li>
						<li>Example 2</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>Our innovative approach brings music to life through
					thoughtful design and advanced technology.</p>
				<h2>Accessibility Consulting</h2>
				<p>Our diverse team offers consulting services to help you make your events and spaces more accessible.
					One notable project is our live captioning system for the Woodstock Cafe, also known as the Sign
					Language Cafe in Portland. This system enables hearing non-signers to communicate effortlessly with
					their deaf colleagues by capturing speech directed at a microphone and displaying real-time
					captions. We provide solutions that foster inclusivity and effective communication.</p>

				<h2>DJ Services</h2>
				<p>Our talented member, known as DeafWish, is an experienced deaf DJ who has successfully performed at
					numerous events. DeafWish brings a unique perspective and energy to each performance, creating an
					inclusive and dynamic atmosphere for all attendees.</p>

				<h2>Workshops</h2>
				<p>We offer workshops led by a highly skilled engineer and educator. These sessions guide participants
					through the process of creating their first audio-reactive device from scratch using affordable and
					accessible technology. Our workshops are a fantastic introduction to programming and hardware
					integration, perfect for beginners and enthusiasts alike.</p>

				<h2>Contact us!</h2>
				<p>For more information or to book our services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:universalmusic@cymaspace.org">universalmusic@cymaspace.org</a>. We
					look forward to working with you to create unforgettable and accessible experiences!</p>
