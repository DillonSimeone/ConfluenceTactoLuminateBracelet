				<h2>Our vision</h2>

					universally accessible.

								<h2>Introducing Gestolumina (GeLu): Redefining Music Accessibility</h2>
								<p>
									Gestolumina (GeLu) stands at the forefront of innovation, revolutionizing the way we
									interact with music. At its core, GeLu is not just a project – it's a transformative
									journey towards inclusivity and empowerment.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our ongoing project involves the development of custom musical instruments in the
									form of two distinct styles of bracelets: one powered by Pixelblaze and the other by
									ESP32. These bracelets are designed to transcend traditional boundaries, allowing
									wearers to control haptics and LED systems through sensors that detect their
									gestures and movements.
								</p>
								<p>
									But GeLu is more than just technology; it's about reimagining what it means to
									create music. With GeLu, your movements become audible, and you have the power to
									transform yourself into music itself. By bridging the gap between gesture and sound,
									GeLu opens doors to a world where anyone, regardless of their hearing ability, can
									actively participate in the creation and enjoyment of music.
								</p>
								<p>This innovative approach significantly enhances accessibility to music for deaf
									individuals, empowering them to express themselves through the universal language of
									music. GeLu isn't just about building instruments; it's about building bridges –
									bridges that connect people, transcend barriers, and enrich lives through the power
									of music. Join us on this extraordinary journey as we redefine what it means to
									experience music.</p>

									Using the SubPac technology, he dials in low-frequency vibrations, enabling the Deaf
									community to independently master their audio mixes and feel the pulse of bass and
									rhythm. It's not just mixing; it's a symphony of empowerment for all.

				<h2>Wearable Innovation</h2>
				<p>
					UMD extends its reach beyond the dance floor, introducing specially designed wearables that pave the
					way towards a groundbreaking bodysuit experience. These innovative garments leverage haptic
					vibration technology, intricately translating music into tangible physical sensations. It's a
					paradigm shift – moving beyond merely listening to music and into a realm where every movement
					becomes an intimate connection with the rhythm.
				</p>

				<h2>The Evolution Towards a Complete Bodysuit</h2>
				<p>
					Our vision doesn't stop at wearables. UMD is committed to pushing the boundaries further, aiming to
					craft a complete bodysuit that encapsulates the entire body in a symphony of vibrations. Imagine a
					future where the immersive experience of feeling the music extends seamlessly from head to toe. It's
					not just a product; it's a transformative journey towards making music an all-encompassing sensory
					adventure.
				</p>

				<h2>Leadership and Expertise</h2>
				<p>
					Nate Hergert, UMD's Program Director, leads our charge, bringing a wealth of experience as a Deaf DJ
					and Music Producer. Under his guidance, we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the
					intersection of technology, music, and inclusivity.
				</p>

				<h2>Research & Development</h2>
				<p>
					Under the expert guidance of Shawn Trail, PhD, our Research & Production Coordinator, and Dillon
					Simeone, our Lead Design Engineer, UMD's initiatives are built upon a robust foundation blending
					percussionist artistry, music production expertise, and cutting-edge computer science. This dynamic
					collaboration ensures that our commitment to continuous research places our projects firmly at the
					forefront of innovation.
				</p>

				<h2>Community Impact</h2>
				<p>
					Supported by the generous funding from the Oregon Community Foundation, UMD is making waves in the
					world of accessible entertainment. Collaborating with figures like Myles de Bastion, Cymaspace
					Founder/President, and esteemed research partners, we're not just creating technology; we're shaping
					experiences that resonate with the community.
				</p>

				<h2>Join the Movement</h2>
				<p>
					Universal Music Design invites you to be part of a revolutionary journey. Explore how we're
					redefining the relationship between music and sensation, breaking down barriers, and making music a
					universal language for all. Step into a world where the rhythm is not just heard but felt.
